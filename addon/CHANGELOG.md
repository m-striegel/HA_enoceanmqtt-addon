## 1.0.1

### üîß What's Fixed

- Custom EEP mapping file was not taken into account (https://github.com/ChristopheHD/HA_enoceanmqtt-addon/issues/74)
- Remove wrong error logs when using external MQTT server (https://github.com/ChristopheHD/HA_enoceanmqtt-addon/issues/73)

### üõë What's Removed

- Entity `cover` have been removed from EEP D2-05-xx to avoid confusion for new-comers. Only entity `cover2` is remaining. `cover2` is not a good entity name but changing it would force current users to review all their automations.

## 1.0.0

### üö® Breaking change !

If you are using debug option, mapping file or MQTT configuration, you will need to reset those configurations after the update

### üéâ Version 1

Since more than 1 year that I made this fork and tried to improve the life of HA Enocean device owners (50+ users when I write those lines), I decided that this addon is stable enough to have a version 1.x release.
